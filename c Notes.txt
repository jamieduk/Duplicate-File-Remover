Example Usage
To scan all files:


./duplicate-remover -d /path/to/directory
This will check for duplicates of all file types.

To scan for duplicates only in .jpg files:


./duplicate-remover -d /path/to/directory -f .jpg
This will only check for duplicates among .jpg files.

Additional Options
Recursive Scanning: You can add -r to check for duplicates in all subdirectories as well.
Auto Removal: Adding -a will automatically remove the detected duplicates without prompting you for confirmation.
This flexibility allows you to tailor the application to your needs, whether you want to scan everything or focus on specific file types.
